The following RfC was posted earlier today in order to end this dispute once and for all. I trust that you will do the same, Phil.  

Talk:Rossville, Staten Island - As part of an ongoing edit war,  has been arbitrarily reverting all additions of external links to the article as """"removal of spam"""". These external links, which had been part of the article since it's creation, are not spam, and were unjustifiably removed. One external link links to an article about the 150th anniversary of the oldest Roman Catholic Church in Staten Island, which is located in the neighborhood. Another external link links to a website created by a former resident who describes what it was like to grow up in the area before it was built up. It seems to me that this Philip Gronowski character, who has recently been resoundingly rejected in his candidacy for RfA, is not making legitimate revisions based on the rules of Wikipedia, but on his own interpretation of what is """"spam"""". I'd like to request that this article be submitted for third party arbitration, and I have exhausted all attempts at a compromise with Mr. Gronowski. I will abide by any decision made by an impartial administrator concerning this dispute. Thank you very much for your consideration.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Genre changes 

Hi, as you can imagine many people have very different opinions as to exactly what genre their favorite (or least favorite) band belongs in.  The editing and re-editing of genres is a never ending cycle on many Wikipedia pages.  If you believe that the genre is not properly assigned to a band, you may want to bring it up on an article's talk page and try to reach a consensus decision, you may find that the discussion has already begun.

Social therapy does absolutely nothing to cure (or properly treat) people with mental illness.

We know meatpuppets are using various fake IPs to add false material and to removal of factual material. In one of many recent disgusting edits by meatpuppet/s, Ryan was accused of having sexual relations with his own daughter. In another disgusting edit Ryan was accused of being born a homosexual. Ryan is dead but his family members are alive to take legal action against these meatpuppets. 

Ryan’s surviving members of his family will continue to correct the distorted, manipulated opinions and views of one book author Mike Richards, whilst all other referenced material is ignored, vandalized and removed. The scapegoat/excuse being used by these meatpuppets is wrong as it is outrageous. Members of the Ryan family are alive and well. 

Supporters of Ronald Ryan will forever unite on the facts of his case and execution. We will continue to contribute the facts, based on the hundreds of references that diagree with Richards personal views. Facts like: There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to prove Ryan fired a shot. 

To put it bluntly, the meatpuppets refuse to allow any contributions on the facts of the Ryan case. Their hatred for Ryan is rather sick and disturbing to say the least.

 Codes and """"minor"""" state 

Please stop Since there is no definition of a """"minor"""" state, there is no need to put it there. Is Algeria """"minor?"""" Iran? It's a nonsense phrase, so it should be deleted. As for making """"MA"""" a country code for Western Sahara, it's not. MA is a code for Morocco, and so it is in Morocco's infobox. EH was created for Western Sahara, so that is its country code. As far as the territory being occupied, this is a clear fact and the position of the United Nations; it is also mentioned in the article in other places. -❤T☮C☺M☯ 
It does not need a definition to be in the article. A minor state is used as opposed to super-power states, permanent members of the security council, ... etc. As to the EH domain, it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for WS but it is not assigned, """".MA"""" being the one used in the territory. The same thing applies for the currency, the MAD is the currency of Morocco, but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. The same thing goes for the IAC 212, the Time zone +0 UTC, etc. They are the ones used in the territory. These things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. As to your ridiculous claim of the UN considering the territory as occupied, I already explained to you the difference between a UN position through the security council that is reiterated again and again, and a voting poll in 1979 of the Algerian-Cuban drafted document, that has no obligation on the UN. The """"Zionism=Racism"""" example is the brightest one for you to understand it. I will revert to the version that was in use before the anon IP started this mess.  
It does Since """"minor states"""" doesn't mean anything, you can't use it in this article; it's nonsense. What states that """".ma"""" is being used in the territory? Do you have any evidence of this at all? The same thing does not apply to currency, since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. To ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which top-level domain name has been assigned to the region; the former is defined entirely by usage, the latter is defined entirely by standards. Western Sahara is clearly occupied, as the article itself still states; I'm not going through this with you again. -❤T☮C☺M☯ 
 Ah we're back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. Minor states is indeed a value judgement - although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena (Algeria is not a big newsmaker per se). But in the interest of neutrality, merely noting """"African, Asian, and Latin American"""" states seems reasonable. At the same time, if Koavf gets to bleat on about minor, it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. Same standards on language. (  )
 Evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in Western Sahara provinces using .ma. It is trivially easy to find that. Koavf's immature partisanship notwithstanding. (  )
What is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in Western Sahara? « D. Trebbien (talk) 23:40 2008 May 5 (UTC)
 Good question. Since effectively all internet service to the Western Sahara is via Maroc Telecom or other Moroccan operators, one would expect that most servers would be located in Moroccan territory (ex-WS provinces), largely in the Casa-Rabat area. Technically I am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located (versus the service). Presumably the Regional Investment Office of Laayoune (http://www.laayouneinvest.ma/fr/index.asp) may have its server physically in Laayoune. Other similar offices may also. It strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code, most sites use the Moroccan address (.ma). Polisario partisans may not like that, but its effective reality. (  )

My address was censored because I was using an account which was apparently improperly named, so I am now using one that IS properly named (AFTER the probation period) and that in and of itself is apparently an offense. Logically, what is going on is that I am being unable to contribute in any way whatsoever because I am being repeatedly punished for a first offense spawned from ignorance. What kind of site are you people trying to run here?!

 It's no wonder the main founder of wikipedia turned his back on it when it's become such a blatant travesty of the intellectual honesty it purports to espouse. I have continuously been censored for editing a biased article- an article which is continuously edited by self-avowed marxists and anti-zionists (the very same people whose POV the article unashamedly puts forward). What kind of encyclopedia has articles that put forward opinion verified by echo chamber sources? If any editor attempted to put that sort of trash in Britannica they would be quickly disassociated with the publication- but it's quite apparent that Wikipedia has no controls whatsoever and has chosen to let the patients run the asylum. There is no use in attempting to run an objective and educational publication when the very people who have discredited the internet as a source of information are allowed to manipulate the site by sourcing the same intellectually dishonest sites that people use wikipedia to avoid. 

In short, explain yourselves- particularly Roland Rance, who has manipulated his position on this site to censor any points he disagrees with- all without explaining why. When you stop accepting the ridiculous assumption that senior members are beyond reproach, perhaps the site will gain some semblance of credibility.

Midwest Accent
I see that you are deleting my corrections regarding the General American accent, in the article """"Midwest,"""" which quite wrongly implies that General American is owned lock stock and barrel by that region.  It's nonsense. The General American accent is spoken all over the north, from Seattle to Connecticut. You are going to have to come up with some citations which realistically and accurately show that the northern accent originated in or is unique to the Midwest, before I'kk allow you continue deleting my writings without a fight. It certainly is not unique to the Midwest, a region which was not even settled by English speakers until barely 150 years ago, after the northern accent was known to exist in places like Pennsylvania and upstate NY, and Connecticut. It really bugs me to see the Midwest taking ownership of an accent which began in the Northeast. The original author blunders badly by lumping the accents of certain urban areas of the northeast in with the rural areas. Anybody from my region, the Syracuse, NY area, formerly Albany, NY, knows that our accent it totally indistinguishable from that of the Midwest. I challange anybody to put a group of Midwestern speakers side-by-side with upstate New Yorkers, and tell which is which. It's impossible, it's the same accent, utterly and completely the same. And we've been speaking this way since before the Midwest was even settled, so it's nonsense to say it's a Midwest accent.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.

Mario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.

The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).

Battle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. 

Every Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.

A new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.

Spaces
There is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do.
Blue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.
Red Space - You lose three coins.
Green Happening Space - A special board event takes place.
Warp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent's space you will warp to.
Mushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small). Choose one, and you will be given either a Mini Mushroom or a Mega Mushroom. (Note: The Mega Mushroom is not always in the large box, and the Mini Mushroom is not always in the small box.)
Battle Space - A battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. The better you finish in the minigame, the more coins you will get back from the pot.
Bowser Space - Bowser may steal items from players or a Bowser minigame may begin.
Fortune Space - A reversal of fortune begins, in which players may have to give coins or stars to others. The player who landed",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi, Daniel.  I noticed you blocked User:Trunkarchive.  I suspect this user's activities formed part of a concerted promotional effort on the part of trunkarchive.com, a media-licensing company, to create bio articles on as many of the photographers in their stable as possible.

 Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.
Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of """"He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s."""" Adding """"to some of the generation"""" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in """"Inertia Coupling"""" or """"Alexander Abian"""" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place """"to come as you are,"""" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute. So the reliable source rules are something I would like to discuss a bit more at length.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Elelland

Hello Humus

I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a """"kangaroo court"""" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.

The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.

Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.

So I studied Eleland a little.

I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.

Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.

Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.

Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?

Can anything be done?

 Misleading reference to study? 

In the section on lead paint in art (which I largely wrote), someone added the following:

""""Lead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time. This is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids, often from fingerprints. [2] As a result, many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration.""""

As I found this surprising, I went and carefully read the study being cited. Their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper, although that wasn't absolutely clear. But lead paint is almost never used that way! Artists working in transparent watercolor (aquarelle) don't usually use white paint, or just occasionally a bit of """"Chinese White"""" (not lead) to make corrections. And opaque watercolors (gouache) and acrylic (polymer) artist's paints typically use titanium dioxide or (rarely) zinc white, but never lead. Normally """"flake white"""" is used only by oil painters, and there's no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints. Cooperstown is a well-respected institution, but as of now I'm sticking with the classic (Ralph Mayer). Flake white may get *slightly* yellowish after centuries, but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above.

I believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article, and adding a new sub-section in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what 99.9% of the people on this earth consider a 'white person' to be, this 99.9% obviously not including alun & slrubenstein.

 Pseudonymous editing 

copied from an email received offline
Hi,

I'm not quite sure how this works, but your wrote in my deletion review, """"you say that your name and address are available, but your contributions to Wikipedia are pseudonymous.""""

Does this mean I hadn't registered? I did so last night, and not under a pseudonym as most people have. I always use my real name in signatures.

And I don't know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no """"post"""" link.

Thanks,
Dennis Bathory-Kitsz
bathory@bathory.org
bathory@maltedmedia.com

Thanks for your message but I think perhaps my meaning was still unclear.  Whether you register or not doesn't really matter since anyone can register under any name.  I could go online and register a Wikipedia account as George W. Bush (at least, if it's not already taken).  Wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently.  All that we know - all that we can know - is what you choose to claim about yourself.  

That's what I meant by pseudonymously - any registration, even if you say that it's your real name, is technically a pseudonym.  It is not independently verified against some external identity database.  And for the most part, that works out very well on Wikipedia.  We want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits, not by making claims to outside credentials.

By the way, anyone could also register as Dennis Bathory-Kitzs.  That trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system.  Such a person could sign their name the same way you do, attempt to mimic your pattern of speech (well, writing really) and make subtle edits just to discredit you.  That, in fact, is a real problem for established editors of Wikipedia.  When we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users, we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit.  Users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from Wikipedia.  But those are all manual checks.  There is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it.

Likewise, no one can inherently trust the email address.  The way internet domains are set up, anyone could register bathory.org and create any email name they wanted.  Like Wikipedia accounts, emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority.  And that's before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery - both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit.

Most people are honest.  But there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn't matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not.  That's why Wikipedia has a policy against original research (which we mean as """"a contribution or assertion based on personal experience"""") and why we never rely solely on self-published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large, well-known organizations - organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing.

Sorry to bore you with all this but my non-Wikipedia profession is information security.  The inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours.  How can a bank know that you're really you?  And how far can that trust be extended?  Under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable?  How do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible.  Unfortunately, there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database - something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate.  

Anyway, I'll get off my soapbox now.  Thanks for your message.

To post to my Talk page, just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on Wikipedia.  The most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the """"edit this page"""" tab at the top.  That will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki-markup symbols.  You should also get in the habit of signing your posts on Talk pages.  You can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes (~~~~).  When you save the page, the MediaWiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date-timestamp.

"05687bcb86751fc2","""::The CTMU is not passing itself off as an """"academic"""" theory. It can't, because Langan is not a member of academia. But then again, a theory need not be academic to be notable. For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).

Byrgenwulf complains that """"we chaps"""" are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. 

It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  

By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. 

This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to take his demands seriously.

 - WP:BLPGOSSIP states that Be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. I am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. I am not sure how the section applies, if you could be more clear it would be helpful.
 - The phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. By this metric, so little can be used that it's almost meaningless. Someone stating their birthdate, or the grade school they attended. But for a person saying """"I have a conflict with Jenny Smith over Issue X"""" - where do we draw the line? It could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing, with one placing on their personal (publicist) website a statement about """"separating for reasons of X"""" is a """"claim about third parties"""", but I wouldn't argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual.

Whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation.  In this case [organic remains] was added to explain the word 'they'.  While W&M; used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition, recently buried remains (such as what is """"now occurring"""") are not fossils.  From the """"Dictionary of Geologic Terms"""", 3rd edition, 1984, by Bates and Johnson:  FOSSIL:  Any remains, trace, or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth's crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time.  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.

W&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.

As much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.

 Question 

Sarah, there is something that I've wondered about for a long time that is related to COI editing.  One need look no further than my user page where I quote Chris Hedges: """"They control our systems of information."""" and add: Surely no one could be so naive as to believe that corporations do not have an interest in turning our encyclopedia into a corporate-approved encyclopedia.  At a certain point one must admit that to not fight the creep of corporate control into our articles really does make us appear to be a bunch of easily-led, lame-brained, losers just willing to go along with the flow rather than to tackle the problem and try to come up with some sort of strategy.  What, if anything, is presently being done?  I'm aware that a few years ago an editor asked for some sort of outside check to """"prove"""" that he had no COI related to the articles he edits, and I've heard of this incident dozens of times since, where it is raised as absolute evidence of a lack of conflict of interest.  Many times I've wondered how Wikipedia went about finding this so-called proof. If I put myself in a position in which I was editing for pay but denied it, how could it be proven that I was?  I mention this because the first thing you know all a paid editor need do is have WP give him/her the WP Stamp of Approval and from then on that editor is home free to do as they please.  They can now proudly display their badge of approval and anyone who questions them is now seen as a disgruntled editor in need of a reality check.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then those who really care about intricacies and details of the chiropractic story can get on with the show and make the article interesting and not some big stats/research battleground.  For the record, I completely agree 100% that effectiveness of chiropractic care is well established for low back disorders (just as good if not better) that manual therapy is effectiveness in neck pain (Task Force 2008) that the results seem favourable for certain types of headaches (TTH, migraine, cervicogenic/headache of cervical origin) and inconclusive and controversial for non-musculoskeletal disorders.  Part of effectiveness too is patient satisfaction scores which patients routinely display a far greater preference for chiropractic care than medical care for LBP.  This is the most succint and precise summary there is.  We can toss the reference in and call it a day.  A majority of editors agree that the current and past evidence, both in research and 3rd parties (governments) favours chiropractic care.

 Colorado balloon incident 

Greetings. I reverted your addition of a news photograph of the Colorado balloon incident balloon. Unfortunately, Wikipedia's use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. As the template you used states: """"Use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature, when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts"""".  It's intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. 

Even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography: Wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because non-free media compromises the freely licensed status of Wikipedia. Refer to the first rule at WP:NFCC; non-free images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. There were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike, almost any would do for the purposes of the article. Wikinews claims that the balloon was low-flying and that photographs were captured by area residents.  

The best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. The effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. I've been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry, though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.

I hope I haven't given the impression that I do not appropriate your contributions to the article— as I do, especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably. Thanks for your contributions!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 This is A Potentially Ridiculous Article 

Seriously, it is a potentially ridiculous article, and mislead readers to comprehend the word """"x86"""", for the following reasons:

1. Should sort AMD64 or Intel64 implementations as x86? Generally """"x86"""" was used to point all the processors compatible with IA-32 ISA, might or might name themselves with """"86"""", such as Cyrix 5x86, Intel Pentium 4 and so on. AMD64's long mode is devised by AMD rather than Intel, so how can one sort them together. Nowadays software labeled themselves as """"x86"""" are IA-32 compatible software, and use """"x64"""" or """"x86-64"""" differentiating with it. So this article confuses reader getting in touch with this word. 

2. Generations? What is the 8th generation x86 processor? Who invented this kinda processors? AMD K8 just says that it succeeds AMD K7 rather than saying it is the 8th x86 processor, and I've never heard Intel call their x86 processors exceeding the 7th generation. And one thing should never be denied, the first generation of Itanium processor says its family model number as 7, which might potentially imply that Itanium might be the 7th x86 processor succeeding Pentium III, but none confirmed this. So take turn back the Transmeta's Crusoe and Efficeon, if the morph firmed on the system board implements x86 decoder call themselves as x86 processors, then if put the same processor on another board implementing PowerPC decoder, then it would be the PowerPC processor? At this situation, what kind of processor is it? Ridiculous! What's more for what sort it as the 7th/8th generation x86? Who is another Jane Austen, making up another Northanger Abbey?

3. """"x86"""" is one architecture(ISA) name? What such a ridiculous thing that I've ever heard on earth! """"x86"""" is used to referring the processor, a kind or series of processors rather than an architecture. If it were the name of an architecture, then in this logic way, Intel 80486 is one of the """"implementation"""" of this """"architecture""""?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

"05c7b99e5b754c4c","Amcom article 

Hi

Earlier today I noticed that there is no article on Amcom, and I posted on the Amnet talk page, before moving it to talk:Amcom (because although the network is called Amnet, the actual company is called Amcom).
I didn't realize until later that there was already an Amcom (actually Amnet) page that had been deleted. After reading the explanation for the deletion, I'm not sure whether Amcom really has enough notability or not. However, if we do want to make an Amcom page we will have to supply some secondary sources to justify the company's notability.

If you are still interested, take a look at this article I found: 

If you want to reply to me, make sure you either reply on my talk page, or leave a note there saying that you have replied elsewhere. Otherwise, I won't know that you've replied.

If I'm wrong, I apologize, but your current behavior isn't helping you any. Rocco is big on erasing embarrassing things from his talk page and now you're doing the same. Even if you're not also a sock of Belchfire, this is not very collegial of you.

Of course, you are wrong, but that is not surprising because you are wrong about so many different things.  Also, I have right to remove each and every thing written on my talk page.  I will continue to do that, especially since many, many of the things written there are just flat out lies.

Yes, it is my fault for adding only the Argov incident, which now makes it sounds as if it was the main reason for invasion, which is of course wrong. So, the sentence:
 """"On 1982-06-06 Israel invaded Lebanon in response to the attempted assassination of Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argov by Abu Nidal in London on June 4.""""
should be expanded. This is a quickie list of basic facts:
 Israel had been bombing Lebanon/PLO for months, from the air, sea and land; and preparing for the invasion (see below, they couldn't have pulled of the invasion in a matter of days otherwise.)
 There was the attempted assassination Shlomo Argov ...
 The assassination attempt was used by Begin as an impetus to shortcut the Knesset's debate and move into Lebanon without full approval. 
 Israel invaded with 60,000 troops.

The consensus was that Hagee is covered adequately in John McCain presidential campaign, 2008. Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.

Alex, thank you for your reply.
I could indeed use a break from this case, but yesterday was a very eventful day, as the case closed and then AGK answered a question I'd initially posed on August 22, meaning that he refused to engage regarding the false allegation he made against during the brief window during which I had a chance to respond to the FoF, and then when it made the response, it not only confirmed the """"judgment on content"""" aspect of the FoF, if begs the question as to why he cited another diff including an exchange with Arzel in which Arzel not only ignores the content of academically published RS, he openly denigrates them in a thread where blocks of text of the Formisano text, for example, had been under direct discussion.

Regarding the perceived legal threat, I had no intention to make a legal threat. That was all sort of sarcastic play on words relating to specific sequence of events in the case, starting with NewYorkBrad's comment on my FoF on August 23, to which AGK refused to reply publicly until the case had been closed yesterday, more than two weeks later. There were also email exchanges between myself and NYB and AGK, which I will have to forward to Jimbo Wales at some point, after clarifying one point made by NYB on his talk page.

The import of the substance is firstly a pun insofar as I make an insinuation about sophistry in the legal field in relation to my perception that AGK aspires to become an attorney (or whatever they're called in Scotland). It is secondly an indication that I have taken the time to register at Wikipediocracy for future reference regarding earlier comments I had made about """"the court of public opinion"""". And when did a little looking around there, finding an entry about NYB, for example, who had advised AGK that he didn't see any misconduct in some of the points of the FoF, so it was thirdly an indirect suggestion that he learn something from someone that is already an accomplished attorney. 

If the reiteration of material deleted by AGK from his User page within the past two weeks is """"outing"""", then that is a policy I shall have to examine. Note that I am not the only editor to have broached the issue of his being an undergraduate in the context of his judgment and actions acting in the capacity of arbitrator in the case at issue.

There's much more to say on this, but I need to get a couple more hours of sleep. I have tried to leave links to relevant discussions at Jimbo's talk page, but have only provided a partial synthesis of the situation, not even contrasting the complete lack of an FoF on Arzel, for instance, with the response provided to me on the PD talk page shortly after the case was officially closed yesterday.

If this statement settles some of the concerns regarding my intentions, and the severity of the infractions thereby diminished, I would appreciate a reduction of the length of the block to facilitate my engaging in the necessary efforts to conduct the appeal without having to exclusively rely on the email system.  連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Theoretically, polygamy can assume any one of three possible forms: polygyny or the marriage of one man to two or more wives at a time, polyandry or the coexistent union of one woman with two or more men, and group marriage or a marital union embracing at once several men and several women.  Of these, only the first is common.

And on page 25 

A statistical analysis of Kaingang genealogies for a period of 100 years showed that 8 per cent of all recorded unions were group marriages, as compared with 14 per cent for polyandrous, 18 per cent for polygynous, and 60 per cent for monogamous unions.

 Misfits (band) and List of Misfits band members 

Please stop. Robo was not the Misfits' drummer in 200/2001. Marky Ramone was the band's official drummer from 2001–2005. Robo merely filled in for Marky on some dates of the 2001 """"M25"""" tour because Marky was unable to make those dates. Robo was not a band member at this time; he was merely filling in, and this is mentioned in the article. Robo did not become the Misfits' official drummer until Marky left in 2005. Your edits are well-intentioned, but are introducing factual errors. Please take the subject to the articles' talk pages in order to discuss the matter before continuing to reinstate your edits.

For reference, I will repost and expand them here.

1. Jimbo Wales has to leave. He should turn over the server admin passwords to a professional, 
responsible IT person who is salaried by the WMF.
 
2. Said IT professional has to make some major changes to the MediaWiki system currently hosting WP. 
Changes would include but not be limited to:

   a. BLPs must be heavily restricted and protected, or better yet, removed entirely.

   b. A proper set of guidelines for editing and administration should be enacted AND ADHERED TO. 
      This would include limitations on the powers of all administrators, and requirements for editors to be
      personally responsible for whatever they do on the wiki. No more IP-address editing. Anyone seeking
      to write for WP must apply and be approved. NO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. """"Assume good faith"""" my ass.

   c. ALL administrators must be elected by OPEN BALLOT, by the editors whose work they oversee.

3. Most critical to the project's success: certain untrustworthy administrators MUST BE REMOVED and 
banned from WP PERMANENTLY. This would include but not be limited to:
    FT2
    Durova
    David Gerard
    JzG
    MONGO
    Jayjg
    Elonka
    Jaakobou
    Raul654

Either make drastic changes, or Wikipedia will continue to decline.

You said that advisors are stationed in Georgia proper, so it's a Georgian mission. Well done! Xeeron, I get 2.87 million links when I google """"South Ossetia War"""". That's English buddy. If only Xeeron, you read the title """"SECURITY COUNCIL HOLDS THIRD EMERGENCY MEETING AS SOUTH OSSETIA CONFLICT INTENSIFIES, EXPANDS TO OTHER PARTS OF GEORGIA"""" South Ossetia Conflict (War) expands, as in already expanded, it says expands, NOT expanding, or about to expand, therefore, the UN knowingly named the war the [2008] South Ossetia War, KNOWING that it will expand. See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is? My arguments haven't evaporated anywhere; South Ossetia is still location-based (my initial argument); it is still where over 90% of the fighting took place; it still has the most important battle (Tskhinvali); my arguments are still here buddy. And Xeeron, I have pointed to you countless times that might doesn't make right. Saying the majority says so, does NOT make it NPOV. If you would have lived in the South during the Civil Rights Movenment you'd realize that might doesn't make right, or NPOV for that matter. I've seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times. Grey Fox - I have proof for how the """"2008 Georgia War"""" is biased; it is biased because it IMPLIES that South Ossetia was a De Facto part of Georgia - which as we all know is bullshit, because if a region is De Facto and De Jure part of a country - there is no war! My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006. So in other words Mr. Grey Fox, and the other two of you, you have FAILED to show my how 2008 South Ossetia War is NPOV, but I HAVE shown you, and cited an example of how 2008 Georgia War would be incorrect and biased. Therefore the title stays, case closed.
