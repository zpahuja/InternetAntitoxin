Hello. I have reverted your edit to Operation Bagration again. The point is not whether Zaloga got his numbers from Krivosheev or not (which doesn't seem to be the case, given the large discrepancy in the numbers). The point is you cannot attribute a claim to a particular author and then cite the claim to another. If you attribute a claim to one author you must cite the appropriate work by that author. If you want to include Krivosheev's figures, then add a sentence along the lines of """"G. F. Krivosheev, however, places the Soviet losses much higher, at 178,507 killed..."""" Moreover, you can't just remove a valid source because you think it's wrong. All information by reliable historians should be cited, especially if there is disagreement on a particular issue, which appears to be the case here.

Further edits have persisted adding """"citation needed"""" tags to the lede: . Since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article (which should be sourced), WP:CITELEAD does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. The first two sections of the article detail transcripts (in which Hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian), diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from 1942 onwards. Sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent, indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. Instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so; if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. Please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence, it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes.

"0651104ccfe11df5","""Kenneth Tennyson's reckless behavior in other forums==

As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:

Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"""" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. 

The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)

While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:

Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. 

Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:

(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)
I see. However, you sounded like a racist.
No, I have no """"South Asian sensitivities"""". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. 

ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of """"greatness"""". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?

Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.

You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as """"obnoxious"""", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! 

(rocky - Asia Times Forum)
What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?

Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? 

That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.

I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

Hmmm. I was actually writing a response as you sent yours. Oh well. For the record, my response was this:

Resurrecting articles is frowned upon, yes. We might be able to get away with it if the article we resurrect is a substantial improvement on the last one, however - though of course we both know that there's no guarantee it would ultimately be accepted whatever we did - there is an established bias towards deleting articles on individual matches. Changing the name would be nice but I'm not sure what we would change to...the game didn't really have a """"name"""" like the Ballet on Ice or any such, and there are limited other ways of naming the article.

Making this subpage was a decent idea, you just got unlucky in that it's something that has already been tried elsewhere and ultimately voted against. Honestly I can say I've never seen a subpage for an actual mainspace article so I have no idea how much people tend to chase these articles up or whether it might just glean a community-wide shrugging of the shoulders. Certainly there's been no AfD nomination yet, which is a start. I have to say I somewhat favour making it a standalone article or merging with the season article (i.e. not keeping the subpage) but I don't have strong feelings so I'll run with whatever works. If it got categorised it would either be put into a category for something like Category:Football matches (I have no idea if that exists, it was another example) and Category:FA Cup and then probably into a new category for City matches or comebacks or somesuch where it probably would be on its own. That category would then have to be categorised so it wasn't just an orphan. I don't know what the ethic is here for creating categories with only a single article in them but I suspect it's not encouraged, so that idea might be rejected if (whoever did it) couldn't find more like-minded articles to categorise into the same. I don't think it being categorised would really affect anyone's opinion of the article though. The one thing that might affect peoples' judgement right now is that it will (in its present form) show up in categories as """"2003‚Äì04 Manchester City F.C. season/Spurs 3-4 City"""" or however the subpage is actually named, given the / in the name.

Yes, I'd say it will currently be located in an overarching """"please categorise these pages"""" category. I don't know how long it would take for it to get sorted, but it would probably be put somewhere generic. Better to do it ourselves, I guess.

Sorry my thoughts were a bit disjointed but I was answering the points as they came and...well, better English just didn't quite flow from my fingers as I typed. Hopefully I addressed all your points. I'll settle for just keeping the subpage if you want it, though I think that page would be best served by being redone - with as many citations as possible - and expanded upon, so we can argue a case for it being reincluded into society, so to speak. Having an article AfD'ed isn't a permanent sign that that article should never exist, it's merely a suggestion that it shouldn't exist in the state it's in. Generally speaking most articles that get deleted will be kept the second time around if their quality and/or level of detail is substantially improved.

As for the Charity Shield, I always considered it a notable trophy. Yes, it's a single game, but it requires winning a trophy to qualify in the first place (ignoring those early years when some teams refused to play). To this end, I'd consider it more of an accomplishment than winning the trophy which qualified you for it. Similarly, would you question the worthiness of the European Super Cup? In fact, because some teams initially didn't enter, City were instrumental in making the Charity Shield the respected competition it is today by taking their place in the competition twice. You could argue that of all the teams to have ever played in it, we should be the ones most ardently defending it.  Talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Although I understand your arguments, I am surprised you don't understand mine.  I don't find it labyrinthine, or at least not particularly so.  (Not more than many other events and aspects concerning the Beatles.)  Nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure, since it can be taken from any number of texts on the Beatles.  However, though I support the original author's intent here, I guess you and I are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now.  At some point, however, I will source his/her statements  as soon as I find time to delve into the texts  just because I would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you.  Until then, I don't think we will make much more progress on this.
 

[The problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth.  But to me, discrediting the original author's intent is like a dog biting its own tail.  From wikipedia: re. Abbey Road being the final album or not:Abbey Road is the eleventh official album recorded by The Beatles. Although its release preceded that of Let It Be, it was the last album to be recorded. 
...
After the near-disastrous sessions for the proposed Get Back album (later retitled Let It Be for release), Paul McCartney suggested to producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album """"just like the old days. .. just like we used to,"""" free of the conflict that began with the sessions for The White Album. Martin agreed to this if the band would be """"the way they used to be."""" In their interviews for the Beatles Anthology series, the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final Beatles' product, and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and """"go out on a high note.""""re. the position of """"The End"""":""""The End"""" was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road, but it is followed by """"Her Majesty"""". In the first practice mix of the medley, constructed on 30 July, """"Her Majesty"""" followed """"Mean Mr. Mustard""""...

Please don't change """"At bat"""" to """"at-bat"""". """"At-bat"""" just redirects right back to at bat anyway. -  

I agree.  

I agree because he is correct that it should not be hyphenated.  

In addition, pls stop edit warring at Matt Joyce (baseball), Ian Kinsler, Craig Breslow, etc.  

And add to the list Matt Guerrier.  It is perfectly accurate and reasonable to reflect his won lost record.  There is no reason to delete it, other than your penchant for disruptive edits.  Kindly desist.  

It has also been explained to you, with proper citations, that the plural of RBI is RBIs.  Pls stop edit warring this point.  See Juan Encarnaci√≥n and Terry Tiffee.  That is vandalism.  
Run batted in says: """"The term may be pluralized as either RBI or RBIs"""". Obviously not vandalism then but a difference in opinion then.
@Matt Guerrier, the reason it didn't show up was because a """"|"""" was missing, and with your edit you re-removed it and duplicated info.
It's amazing how you continue to assume bad faith, blindly reverting and editwarring over messages on his own talk page... ¬†(t¬†/¬†c) 

Danged if this little war isn't over some seriously picayune crap. Both sides are being a bit petty here, because really either set of edits is acceptable on these pages (well, except for the bolded Contract on Ian Kinsler  either make it a subhed or take it off, seriously).

Oh, and technically, the plural of RBI is RsBI, but that just looks clunky. In common usage, """"RBI"""" is used for either singular """"Run Batted In"""" or plural """"Runs Batted In"""". """"RBIs"""" is a bastardization used only because it's simpler from a usage standpoint.

Either way, I think everyone involved in this should chill out for a few days and just leave all these pages alone. -  

Jackal4, again, is making a rash of these edits on every page I touch.  As to RBIs, as X96lee15 pointed out the most thorough treatment is at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Baseball/Archive_5#RBIs.  Plus, mlb.com is the official reporter of baseball, and uses the RBIs convention.  Yet, Jackal4's reaction to that is to go on pages where I have written it thus, to delete the s  as though the s is incorrect.  He has done the same with """"at bat""""  which he insists must be hyphenated.  Etcetera .... these are just two of the types of reverts he feels impelled to make of my edits.  It is picayune, but it is wrong to revert perfectly good edits.  If he insisted on lower-casing RBIs, or any similar degradation, I would think it wrong of him to follow people around and revert perfectly good edits.  There is enough good work he could perform instead.  

 Well, I can't stop him from wasting time if that's what he wants to do ) .

 As for """"thorough treatment"""", I'm not sure I consider a bit to which a grand total of two people contributed particularly thorough. I respect Kingturtle, but I think he's got it wrong on this one. Regarding what mlb.com uses, you're appealing to the wrong authority, because it's not a terminology issue, it's a grammar issue.

 In any case, at this point I have no doubt that these edits are being reverted simply because you're both watching for each other's names on your watchlists. Allow me to again encourage the both of you to just stay away from each other's edits entirely for a while and allow the bad feelings to ebb. At the rate you're going, you're both going to get blocked. -  

Jargon overrides grammar. To say that a batter """"flied out"""" is probably not good grammar either, but it's proper baseball terminology. I think this needs to be discussed at the project page, assuming anyone's watching that page anymore. [[User:Baseball",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Legislation: European Union

The source reads: """"The European Union has just ratified a law ‚Äúbanning incitement to or denial of genocide‚Äù (arguably including both the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide)."""" Some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. 
 Let's have a look at the law itself. 
 Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia
 Official Press Release
 Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group.

 Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.

 Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
 As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:
 the commission of genocide is established by an international court and
 the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred

The House of Saint Vladimir is of descent from a Travunian local noble house, with doubtable links to the House of Trpimirovic and most surely no link to the House of Viseslavic. 
However, I must object putting it as a separate line - Tvrtko asserted rule and his line (Tvrtkovic) is historically considered the main line of the Kotromanics.

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD‚Äôs conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel‚Äôs office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

Happy New Year, Wack'd!  Since you've assessed quite a few good articles and contributed to them, I thought I could solicit your assistance.  I've submitted two articles for peer review, and thought that you might be of some help in critiquing them:
Duck Soup. I've listed this article for peer review because, even though I and other editors have contributed much information and references, I'm certain that there are other aspects of this classic film that have yet to be covered. I'd like to hear feedback from you, so that I can get help in improving this (and other Marx Brothers films) quality.
Princess Leia Organa. I've listed this article for peer review because it right now seems oddly cluttered and, despite a lot of references as of now, lacks reliable source citations.  Although I've already requested another peer review, as long as it helps the articles get better, I've got the time. Any helpful comments will certainly be appreciated, as this should help me in expanding other Star Wars-centric articles.
If you have the time, it'd be great if you could review those articles and assess their strengths and weaknesses.  Thanks, and a Happy New Year to you! ‚Äî  (talk  ‚Ä¢  contribs)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Witness Brigish English, Mandarin (linguistics), Flemish (linguistics), Ashkenazi Hebrew, Cantonese (linguistics), American English, Sephardi Hebrew, etc etc... Arvanitic is a dialect according to all our sources as interpreted by Wikipedia policy, therefore Arvanitic language or Arvanitika language are out of the question. I don't want to use Arvanitika Albanian as it will be too controversial (so i don't want Albanian in the title). Therefore, the only options are Arvanitic or Arvanitika. They can and should be used. Arvanitic has the majority vote, and therefore that shall be used. What is wrong with it? It is neutral. It does not prescribe that Arvanitic is a language or a dialect and as it has been pointed out, the reader can review all the evidence for himself/herself and see what he/she thinks. Wikipedia should not take sides and especially Wikipedia should not say that UNESCO, Britannica etc aree wrong. Macedonian and Luxembourgish etc CAN be treated as languages because all neutral credible sources say they are (while the same sources say that Arvanitic is a dialect). If Britannica or UNESCO etc said that they were dialects, then they could be treated as such. No neutral source formally aknowledges that they are dialects. Why should they be treated as such. Every neutral source says that Arvanitic is a dialect and therefore should be treated as such and the word language should not be in the title. We can discuss possibilities of it being a language in the text, but NOT in the title. Arvanitic is neutral and will be used as it has received he majority support. Possibilities of Arvanitic being a language in its own right can be discussed in the article, NOT in the title as that would be a violation of Wikipedia's policies. What UNESCO, Britannica etc say is assumed correct according to WP:V and WP:NOR. I am not labeling Arvanites Albanians against their will. Are we labeling the Irish English against their will by calling their language (Hiberno English) a dialect of English? No! So stop that straw man argument. Arvanitic is neutral and will not offend anyone AND has majority support here and will be used according to policy. The world is not made to please you, neither is Wikipedia.

As a close follower of the language-political issues in Finland, I have always disliked this intentional fudging of mother tongue's significance in defining what, if you will, we could call """"ethnic identity"""" especially when it comes to Finnish-speakers. Swedish-speakers have identified themselves very clearly as essentially an ethnic group all the way until the latter half of last century, when it became much more politically convenient to start pushing the idea of the entire people having """"two languages"""", which from individual people's mother-tongue point of view is patent nonsense  the mother tongue of, say, my entire family tree is Finnish and what Swedish they speak has been taught to them at school as essentially foreign language. Whatever happens in the future, our language policy has not yet managed to implant Swedish as a general second language in the population, and this must be taken into account here. I can well understand how Fenno-Swedes can identify as some sort of particular subgroup and still be considered """"Finnish"""", but there is always the flipside of such a coin.   13:39, 21 August 2009""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for uploading Image:Ciara-TheEvolution -Front-.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Hello Deacon, thanks for the kind words. Your wording is better regarding territory, but I think that it still might specifically mention the Firth of Clyde, since Northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about """"between the Humber and the Firths of Clyde and Forth"""", or similar? But there's no great preference here either way.

Oswiu chose the Roman way at Whitby in 664, and he died in 670; thereafter there was a steady erosion of Iona-based clerics in Northumbrian territory, quite noticeable by Pehthelm's consecration in the 8th century ... have a look at the Skene reference I cite, which suggests that both Picts and Northumbrians were working in concert in the early 8th century towards the Roman way in preference to the Columban way.

It looks like a political process, constant and steady, but not a sudden, forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of Northumbrian hegemony. Northumbria's fortunes were up-and-down in the 7th century regarding its southern neighbors, particularly Mercia, and that is not to suggest that anyone chose Deiran preferences over Bernician ones. I'm aware of the substantial history of Iona-based clerics in Bernicia, but times change (and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons).

The translation of Pehthelm's name without stated authority is indeed sourced ... the claim is made flat-out, so have a look at the reference cited; I tried to make sure that anyone who likes to check out references can do so easily ... indeed, you should be able to quickly access every citation that I made in the article.

Notes and References
Shortcut:
WP:FNNR

Notes and References appear after See also (click on image for larger view).
Main page: Wikipedia:Citing sources#How to format and place citations
Contents: These sections present (1) citations that verify the information in the article, and (2) explanatory notes that would be awkward in the body text. Some articles divide this type of information into two or more separate sections; others combine it into a single section. There is no consensus establishing a particular structure when footnotes and the works cited in those footnotes are placed in separate sections.
Title: The most frequent choice is """"References""""; other articles use """"Notes"""", """"Footnotes"""", or """"Works cited"""" (in diminishing order of popularity). The title """"References"""" may be inappropriate if the section contains both explanatory notes and citations. Several alternate titles (""""Sources"""", """"Citations"""", """"Bibliography"""") may also be used, although each is problematic: """"Sources"""" may be confused with source code in computer related articles; """"Citations"""" may be confused with official awards or a summons to court; """"Bibliography"""" may be confused with a list of printed works by the subject of a biography. With the exception of """"Bibliography,"""" the heading should be plural even if it lists only a single item.[9]

Further reading
Shortcut:
WP:FURTHER
A guideline on further reading sections is proposed at Wikipedia:Further reading.
Contents: An optional bulleted list, usually alphabetized, of a reasonable number of editor-recommended publications that would help interested readers learn more about the article subject. Editors may include brief annotations. Publications listed in Further reading are cited in the same citation style used by the rest of the article. The Further reading section should not duplicate the content of the External links section, and should normally not duplicate the content of the References section, unless the References section is too long for a reader to use as part of a general reading list. This section is not intended as a repository for general references that were used to create the article content.

They should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version  and not even bothering to explain why, it is unacceptable.

A poor start, sorry. The author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. First of all, no common two-nations table is possible (patent nonsense). Second, I object the following:
the passage from the Russian table speaking of the Kievan Rus. As someone suggested earlier, that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between Kievan Rus and modern Russia. This is the main disputed claim (commented enough in other articles), unacceptable for me and several other Ukrainian and Belarusian users
Regardless of any """"Ukrainian military"""" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian. For instance, Red Army units widely participated in war crimes against Ukrainian population and anti-Soviet guerillas. Creation of the """"Ukrainian"""" table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all Ukrainian users. For instance, see earlier AlexPU's passage on """"trading the truth""""

 Third Party Review, WikiProject New York Posting 
Transferred from User Page:
Hi Cmagha! I never saw the original AfD discussion, but I think the article looks like the start of something fantastic! My only concern would be that the majority of your references seem to come from """"Cornell specific"""" sources (i.e. Cornell Daily Sun, Cornell Era, Cornell Register, etc...). College/ university published sources are a bit of a grey area within WP:N when dealing with a campus organization, as some may not consider these to be """"independent of the subject."""" That being said, we aren't dealing with a fly by night college band that played at Moonshadows and had a writeup in the Ithacan, this is a literary society almost as old as Cornell University itself and has had significance well beyond East Hill. Despite the large number of CU oriented sources (which I personally believe are independent), you have enough that would be unambiguously independent to survive another AfD if need be. I'd post what you have now and keep looking for more! ' says you, says two  
 Wow, great work.  Sorry I've been out of the loop.  Double smiley face from the Syracuse Orangemen brought in to ensure neutrality.  Think the critics need to read the article from a distance  this is hardly promotional, when you think about it.  It is basically saying that Cornell University had a chance to excell in an intellectual activity, and tanked.  We obviously would not have done that at SU.  I do think there is a Sumner cite out there to, that Cmagha missed.  Will look for it.

 More description of location please? 

Hello, I wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence, maybe in the description section, to explain where this bridge is? I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like """"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage"""" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. Go on, please write it for me, you know you want to; and I will go and put the kettle on for you. Thanks and best wishes   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

"075a4b83f3eba42f","""Changes to this Page - Open discussion ==
Since my first contribution over two months ago, I have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. After an initial consultation with an administrator I decided to """"be bold"""" and start a """"d√©menagement"""" of all that had nothing to do with the city of Paris. I was met with opposition over a link - and after being complained about I thought it best to put things back the way they were until I could get a good feel of the """"general concensus"""" of the page's contibutors. I have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.

My goal here is not to """"control"""" anything, as was complained to one of the administrators - I would like only to contribute to making a better page. I have learned much from other Paris pages and pages concerning French history - namely those concerning the French kings - but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement, so I had little to do there. This page, on the other hand, I find lacking, and see many things that could be improved.

The most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information - far too much for a general """"Paris"""" page. The search function is a very important element of Wikipedia, and with this in mind, much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. Those looking for """"Paris economy"""" will type exactly that into the search window. The same for """"Paris history"""" or """"paris fashion"""". Here I am but repeating what I have already written below.

In short, in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of Paris, or one totally ignorant on the subject  - in other words, one who knows only enough to type only """"Paris"""" into the search window - I propose to move the more """"specialty"""" information to their own pages. My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a """"specialty"""" page of its own. This would even be a positive move, as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.

The irony of the sort is that, though I contribute to Wiki, it won't be to this page in any quantity. My specialty is the history of Paris, and I cannot even think to add that knowledge here - Paris' history has a page of its own. Just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.

Here I would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. I hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement - please answer with any ideas you would have. With this post I would also like to """"sound the board"""" - to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page, as what I have seen to date leaves room for doubt. In your answers, I hope for evidence to the contrary. 

Please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all.

CHRISTIAN DEATH

BIOGRAPHY
&
Discography  

In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. Then Christian Death turned it upside down.

History
Officially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band. Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.

Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album ‚ÄúOnly Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke up

Singer Rozz then joined the band ‚ÄúPompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.
Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album ‚ÄúLook At Yourself‚Äù to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.

Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic ‚ÄúCatastrophe   Ballet‚Äù.
Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album‚ÄùAshes‚Äùwhich was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. 

After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album ‚ÄúThe Wind Kissed Pictures‚Äù, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album ‚ÄúAtrocities‚Äù inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album ‚ÄúThe Scriptures‚Äù, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.

1988 Brought us the release of ‚ÄúSex & Drugs & Jesus Christ‚Äù. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.

1989 saw the release of the double album epic ‚ÄúAll the Love, All the Hate‚Äù interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.

In 1991 came the release of ‚ÄúInsanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque‚Äù, with its theme of an ancient dream state.

Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor",0,0,0,0,0,0

You are calling me right wing, so you will be waiting a while for your apology, when Ukip are represented in a true light and not by left leaning sources. You will get one.

Parts of my own Talk Page deleted by editors who think they know better

Dear impartial but not disinteresed reader, Coren and I have been having an entertaining and enjoyable """"discussion"""" on the finer points of """"soapboxing"""".  She is of the firm, resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to """"soapboxing"""" and has deleted it.  I recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the """"investment predictions for 2008"""" section at the bottom of the page, but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section.  She has declined the opportunity to amend, leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever-so-gently against my back, with Coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is, in her God-like view, """"soap-like"""".  Not the most pleasant position to be in, I can assure you.

To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that """"soapboxing""""??

To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, """"What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"""", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading """"Heeeeelp"""".  

And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: """"Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""""

As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  

He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page: 

""""I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on """"Monetary Crankery""""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""""

Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or """"satirizing"""" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   

Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more """"editing"""".  

Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called """"cannabis culture"""" and """"the Buddhist connection with marijuana"""".  So, I gather from this that his main """"interests"""" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!

Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  

It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as """"soapboxing"""".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    

This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.

Frankly this is a waste of everybody's time.  It serves no purpose to repeat the arguments against inclusion over again, full in the knowledge that you will not accept them.  Your spiels of wikilawyering have demonstrated very little on the whole.  You have consistently failed to assume good faith, and you have not convinced anyone that your biased original research belongs in the article.  You claimed that four days ago you did not know what a talk page was.  Yet, you are now lecturing users who are far more experienced than you in these matters on your beliefs on Wiki policy.  We haven't moved on significantly.

If you cannot accept that on controversial articles the standard of """"challenged, or likely to be challenged"""" is higher than elsewhere, then you are in no position be lecturing policy to us.  WP:UCS is a guide - an essay, not policy.  In any case, common sense dictates that on controversial articles, material is more likely to be challenged than on non-controversial ones.  This is challenged material and you require a better cite than the ones you gave us.  The material has implications for NPOV.  These are the facts that are relevant here.

Canadian Ethnic Studies Journal,  Spring, 2001  by Monica Boyd,  Doug Norris]:

 """"At the close of the twentieth century, """"Canadian"""" has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group, up from 0.5 percent in 1986 to nearly 4 percent in 1991 and to 31 percent in the 1996 census of Canada. From what groups did this """"indigenous"""" label draw in the five years between the 1986-1991 and the 1991-1996 censuses? Using unpublished tabulations from the 1986, 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses, this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the Canadian-born age 25-44 in 1986 (and age 34-54 by 1996). We find that most of the increases between 1986 and 1991 in """"Canadian"""" ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in British origin responses. Between 1991 and 1996, increasing Canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the British and French ethnic origin counts. In some provinces, notably the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups.""""

While visiting the Jab We Met article, I was very much impressed at your good work. However I've one small grudge that I raised on the article's talk page as well. This refers to the excessive number of non-free fair-use images in the article. As per the non-free guidelines the usage of excessive images is to be reduced and to be limited as much as possible. Most of these images carry Shahid and Kareena's images and hence 6 images is far too high. I was hoping to discuss this with you before removing them from the article page. Also I hope that you don't mind me doing quick checks for MOS consistency and additional info.

I've changed the heading along the lines you suggested, to """"Criticisms of Michael Dorris"""", which I hope tackles the question you raised.  Feel free to alter it further, of course!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Talk:Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona might interest you.  

 Peter III of Aragon 

What is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of Peter over a contemporary coin? Your edits are predominantly changes to lead images, yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. You also reverted my change without even knowing what """"contemporary"""" means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. The reasons to prefer the coin are:
it is a contemporary artefact, giving information about Peter's reign (w/ a caption) and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetime
the coin does not mislead readers about the times of Peter III, as the portrait might
the silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in low-resolution JPG format
it is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate (clean shaven and long-haired) than the greater detail of the imaginary portrait
the later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later, it gives us no information about Peter or his reign, its sole purpose was decorative
what makes the coin an image of Peter is that that is when it was struck and what for, but what makes the later portrait an image of Peter is that somebody labelled it that way‚Äîthey could just as easily have labelled an image of any other Aragonese king

In your last edit summary, you ask """"if I have to choose between two unreal representations, I prefer the portrait"""", but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer.   

Srnec, the problem is that we have different criteria.
